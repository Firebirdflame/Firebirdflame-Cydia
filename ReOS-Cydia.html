                <p class="BoxText"> ReOS started in March 2014. I  completed two themes to that date and was finishing my third one. ReOS was my first theme that I changed my perspective of developing themes. I normally thought to create whatever I felt like at the time and hoped it would be accepted. I later learned this wasn't the best route. So I held off on further developement for ReOS and decided to study a bit on what makes a theme a <i>good</i> theme. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSThemes" style="color: #65b7c7;" target="_blank"> /r/iOSThemes</a> really helped in growing my understanding of theming. Plus, I was highly praised in the early development of ReOS which only inspired me to continue.
                    <br /><br />
                    
                    I know it's impossible to please everyone with a theme. Either they don't like the messages icon, or wish they could change the weather icon. So, with this in mind, I decided to include every single icon I ever made for ReOS in the final package. Looking back, I can't believe I came up with such unappealing icons, but others really wanted my theme simply because of those few icons. As you can see with Safari, my first take is pretty original with the red part of the compass. The color choice and gradient seemed dated to me, so I quickly changed the looks to the second icon. But, as you can see, it took four designs before I was happy. I personally love the fourth icon. You might hate it and that's okay. That's why I include all four icons for users to choose from.
                    <br /><br />
                    The most important thing that I learned was to <i>make my theme unique</i>. If you look at my other 3 themes, you might notice a lot of the icons are the same, just different colors. ReOS started from scratch. Every color and shape I personally designed.
